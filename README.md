# PersonnelManager
This repository implements PHP, CSS, HTML, and SQL concepts to create a personnel management system for a company. Upon using the system for the first time, the user must click "Yes" on the login screen. Upon clicking 'submit', a PersonnelManager database is created and used throughout the duration of the systems existence. Once the database is created, 4 tables (Employee, Department, Project, and Employee_Images) are created with data fields populating it. An administrative account is created upon the database's creation so users can login.

Once user's are signed in, they have the ability to make use of many different functionalities, such as adding employees to the database, deleting employees from the database, editing employee information, and searching for employees.

This was created for the Spring semester 2017 Advanced Web Technologies Class with Professor Jung (Framingham State University).
